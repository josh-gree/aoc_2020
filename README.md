# Advent of code 2020

So I have quit my job early and I am unemployed for the whole month of December. This coincides with Manchester being in COVID lockdown and so I should ake use of this time! I have never completed an entire AOC and so maybe this is my year!?

I want to try and complete in two languages;

- Python - this is my language of choice and so hopefully should be able to complete quite easily...
- Scala - really have little knowledge but want to use this as a reason to learn - will need some luck to finish this...
